# IML Term Project

This project was done for the Introduction to Machine Learning course in Unviersity of Helsinki. The objective of the project was to train a machine learning model on labeled NPF data and than to predict unlabeled data using that model. There were 3 scoring methods for the models: binary accuracy, multi-class accuracy and perplexity.
